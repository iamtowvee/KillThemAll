# KillThemAll
A game in the arcade shooter genre.

---
## Gameplay
You appear in the labyrinth. You have a starting pistol with 5 bullets. Monsters are all around, spawning randomly across the map. Your goal is to clear the area and find the exit.

## The goal
Clearing a zone means killing a certain number of monsters. This number may vary depending on the chosen difficulty level. After clearing the area, the goal is to find a way out of the labyrinth. Although this can be done during the clearing, in this case, monsters will constantly interfere with you.

## Enemies
The game features several types of monsters. Here's a list:
1. **Warrior.** Normal monsters that attack in close combat. They have health from __30__ to __90__ units, depending on the difficulty level.
2. **Thrower.** Ranged monsters. They have __10__ to __50__ health, depending on the chosen difficulty level.
